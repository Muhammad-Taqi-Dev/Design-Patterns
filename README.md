# Software Design Patterns

This repository covers the **three main categories of software design patterns**—**Creational, Structural, and Behavioral**—as defined by the _Gang of Four (GoF)_.

Design patterns provide **reusable solutions to common design problems** in object-oriented software. Mastering them helps you build systems that are **flexible, modular, scalable, and easy to maintain**.

The repository uses **real-world examples**, often inspired by the **aviation industry** (e.g., F-16s and Boeing aircraft), to clearly demonstrate practical usage.

## 📂 Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are divided into the following categories:

- **Creational**
- **Structural**
- **Behavioral**

Each category focuses on a different aspect of object-oriented design.

---

## 🏗️ Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns focus on **object creation mechanisms**.  
Uncontrolled object instantiation can introduce tight coupling and maintenance issues. These patterns **encapsulate and manage object creation**, improving flexibility.

### Patterns Included

- Builder Pattern
- Prototype Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern

---

## 🧩 Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns deal with **class and object composition**.  
They help form larger structures while keeping the system flexible and minimizing dependencies.

### Patterns Included

- Adapter Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Proxy Pattern

---

## 🔄 Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns define **object interaction and responsibility delegation**.  
They improve communication between objects and make behavior easier to extend or modify.

### Patterns Included

- Interpreter Pattern
- Template Pattern
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Memento Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- State Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Visitor Pattern

## ✈️ Examples

Most examples in this repository are inspired by **aviation systems**, using scenarios from:

- Fighter aircraft (e.g., F-16 systems)
- Commercial airplanes (e.g., Boeing architectures)

These analogies make complex design concepts easier to understand.

## 🎯 Interview Preparation

If you are preparing for **technical interviews**, focus on the following patterns first:

### High-Priority Patterns

- All **Creational Patterns**
- Decorator
- Proxy
- Iterator
- Observer
- Visitor

While studying, review **Java Framework API examples** related to each pattern to understand their real-world implementations.
